# SWEusingDCGAN
Steganography without Embedding using DCGANs based on the paper "A Novel Image Steganography Method via Deep
Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks"(link:https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8403208). To my knowledge, this is the first full implementation of this paper.

#Instructions
Since code was written in Google Colab, the code has been attached in the form of an ipynb file. 
For best experience, kindly open it in google colab.(Go to Colab->Open Notebook->Upload->Select ipynb file)

Once notebook has been opened, follow below steps:
1. For uploading dataset to runtime, first generate Kaggle API token and upload the kaggle.json file to runtime
   (refer to first 3 steps in this article: https://www.kaggle.com/general/74235)
2. Run all the code cells one after another.
3. In order to change number of epochs or any other hyperparameters, kindly refer to the hyperparameter code cell.
